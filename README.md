# A BASIC to MIPS Compiler
I've read Austin Henley's tutorial [Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) for writing a compiler for a BASIC dialect to C. My plan is to extend the extend the existing compiler to create an abstract syntax tree, emit MIPS instead of C code and rewrite the project in Rust.
